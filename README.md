# kira

Kira is a lightweight replacement for the overall much too complex and weird to use jackson object mapper.
It's primary purpose is translating Java Objects into maps that only contain non abstract data types. Those can be serialized in JSON or YAML very easily. 

## Supported formats
- JSON
- YAML
- XML
